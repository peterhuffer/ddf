Harvester Listeners register themselves to Harvesters and listen for their Create, Update, and Delete events.

=== Installing the Harvester Listener

The Harvester Listener is installed by default with a standard installation of the ${ddf-catalog} application.

=== Configuring the Harvester Listener

Configure the Harvester Listener from the ${admin-console}:

. Navigate to the *${admin-console}*.
. Select the *${ddf-catalog}* application.
. Select the *Configuration* tab.
. Select *Harvester Listener*.

Harvester Listeners take a single configuration field called *ID*. The *ID* must match the ID of an existing configured Harvester. The listener will use this *id* to pair itself with the correct Harvester.
